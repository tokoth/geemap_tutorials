# Geemap Tutorials

This is a self-paced learning repo on the use of geemap python package for interactive mapping using earth engine data and ipyleaflet.

The materials used in this project are from the geemap package by Qiusheng Wu found here https://github.com/giswqs/geemap.

In attempt to learn and understand the concepts used, I use the examples and write my notebooks with the location centered over my home country,Kenya.
